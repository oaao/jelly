# jelly

Simple EVE Online jam chance calculator in Python that runs from the command line.

Don't forget skill/role and module multipliers when inputting values, as the program does not do this for you.

For more information about this extremely well-designed and balanced mechanic, please look at:

Jelly will later be used as a test platform for learning how to deploy a Flask web application.
